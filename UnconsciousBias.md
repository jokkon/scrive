## Training development organisations to deal with Unconcious Bias
Managing Unconscious Bias is hard, as it is a fairly unknown concept and done unconsciously. Without the knowledge and tools, most will not be able to address the problematic behaviour they unconsciously is presenting. Read more in Facebooks site regarding the topic: https://managingbias.fb.com/

## Agenda
The agenda is originally stretched over a total of three occasions. This both as to not get aggressive push back behaviour for the new information and to let the participants to reflect the new knowledge on themselves. Be aware, that this will probably back-fire if the company per se have not well defined goals regarding equality in the workplace.

1. All participants do the Gender-Science Implicit Association Test (IAT) developed @Harvard University: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html
2. The participants gather for a showing of the Facebook training session. Either this is done by setting aside time to also be able to open up for discussion and to let the participants do the small tests within the training video (add extra 25mins), or just straight up watch it as for example a lunch and learn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZbuH7HhFPU
3. Final session is where colleagues meet up in smaller (5-10ppl) groups, with a line manager and/or facilitator to discuss their feelings and reactions regarding the training session: 
* Regarding unconscious bias at large 
* How it affects the hiring process and
* How it affects the interaction in the office/between teams
* If the participants had a gender-science biases (IAT results are personal and are optional to share)
* If they before the earlier session believed they had any biases
* Thereafter it is good to describe the Company standpoint regarding workplace bias and equality, and what goals the company has regarding diversity. This is then used to see if there are any changes/additions to work-agreement the team has that can help fulfill the company diversity goals and create a grow ground for a more diverse and less homogenous work environment.

## Consider
If there is not a strict decision that Diversity is a company goal, this training will probably backfire in the discussion-stage. If the company is not at will to fight for workplace diversity the discussions will probably go into the "shall we hire a worse female instead of a good male"-space, which can be really hard to answer if you haven't already given a conscious answer to that question (for example "we don't believe in hiring supermen, instead we strive to create an innovation through diversity...", "we don't believe there are no good female in our field out there, and we will pay the premium to get them...", etc).
